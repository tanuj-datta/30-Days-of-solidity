# 30-Days-of-solidity

## This is all about learning the solidity contracts in 30 days step-by-step from scratch to the advanced concepts of it. 
*** 
## Contents :

## Day 1: Introduction to Solidity :


### Learn about Solidity's features and its role in blockchain development.
### Understand the basics of smart contracts and their applications.

## Day 2-3: Environment Setup :


### Set up the necessary tools and software for Solidity development.
### Install the Solidity compiler (solc) and an Ethereum development framework like Truffle or Hardhat.

## Day 4-6: Solidity Basics :


### Familiarize yourself with Solidity syntax, data types, variables, and functions.
### Learn about contract structure, modifiers, and visibility specifiers.


## Day 7-9: Control Structures and Looping :


### Understand control structures like if-else statements, switch statements, and loops in Solidity.
### Practice writing conditional and looping constructs.


## Day 10-12: Function Modifiers and Events :


### Explore function modifiers and their role in enforcing access control and conditions.
### Learn about events and their importance in emitting and logging contract events.


## Day 13-15: Solidity Data Types and Structures :


### Dive deeper into data types like arrays, mappings, and structs.
### Understand how to use these data structures effectively in Solidity contracts.

## Day 16-18: Inheritance and Polymorphism :


### Learn about contract inheritance and how to create reusable code with inheritance.
### Explore polymorphism and its application in Solidity contracts.

## Day 19-21: Error Handling and Exceptional Situations :


### Understand error handling techniques in Solidity, including assert, require, revert, and try-catch.
### Learn how to handle exceptional situations and ensure contract safety.

## Day 22-24: Ethereum Development Tools and Testing :


### Familiarize yourself with tools like Truffle or Hardhat for testing and deploying Solidity contracts.
### Learn how to write unit tests and conduct contract testing.

## Day 25-27: Security Best Practices :

### Study common security vulnerabilities and best practices in Solidity.
### Understand concepts like reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, and code injection.

## Day 28-30: Advanced Solidity Concepts :


### Explore more advanced topics such as libraries, interfaces, and abstract contracts.
### Study contract upgradability patterns and proxy contracts.
